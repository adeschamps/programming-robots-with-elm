I'm Anthony Deschamps. I work in robotics. Here are my credentials <photo from robofest>.

- How many people grew up with lego robots / have kids who play with them?




<screenshot of elm home page "delightful language...">

The Elm home page describes it as "a delightful language", and I
really like that description because it focuses on the experience of
using it - not just the end result. Now, I'm not really a web
developer. I mostly work in robotics. However, I still really like
that idea of a language being delightful, and I wanted to answer the
question "what would it be like to use Elm to program a robot?"

So, Elm is a language that's focused on a particular application, but...

- Can Elm be used to program a robot? (spoiler: yes)

If it couldn't then this would be a fairly short talk.


- Is it __delightful__ for robotics? (sometimes!)

- What can we learn? (what parallels with web dev?)
